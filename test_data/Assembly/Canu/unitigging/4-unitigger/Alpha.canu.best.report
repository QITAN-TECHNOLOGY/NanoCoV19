BEST EDGE FILTERING
-------------------
At graph threshold 12.0000%, reads:
  available to have edges:            9
  with at least one edge:             9

At max threshold 12.0000%, reads:  (not computed)
  available to have edges:            0
  with at least one edge:             0

At tight threshold 0.0480%, reads with:
  both edges below threshold:         2
  one  edge  above threshold:         6
  both edges above threshold:         1
  at least one edge:                  9

At loose threshold 0.2638%, reads with:
  both edges below threshold:         9
  one  edge  above threshold:         0
  both edges above threshold:         0
  at least one edge:                  9
