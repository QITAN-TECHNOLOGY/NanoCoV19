PARAMETERS:
----------
   1000    (reads trimmed below this many bases are deleted)
 0.1200    (use overlaps at or below this fraction error)
    500    (break region if overlap is less than this long, for 'largest covered' algorithm)
      2    (break region if overlap coverage is less than this many reads, for 'largest covered' algorithm)

INPUT READS:
-----------
   959 reads      1194702 bases (reads processed)
     0 reads            0 bases (reads not processed, previously deleted)
     0 reads            0 bases (reads not processed, in a library where trimming isn't allowed)

OUTPUT READS:
------------
    62 reads       928975 bases (trimmed reads output)
    19 reads       264749 bases (reads with no change, kept as is)
   878 reads            0 bases (reads with no overlaps, deleted)
     0 reads            0 bases (reads with short trimmed length, deleted)

TRIMMING DETAILS:
----------------
    21 reads          378 bases (bases trimmed from the 5' end of a read)
    53 reads          600 bases (bases trimmed from the 3' end of a read)
